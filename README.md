Loan Data Analysis & Visualization

Dataset:
This dataset was generated by an American bank (not created by me). It contains information about loans, which I analyzed to explore trends and prepare the data for machine learning applications.

Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to clean, preprocess, and visualize loan data to make it ready for the next phase â€” applying machine learning algorithms for credit risk prediction.

Techniques Used:

Handling missing values and NaN entries

Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques tailored for credit risk management

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Key Focus:
Preparing a high-quality dataset that can be effectively used for training ML models related to credit risk assessment.
